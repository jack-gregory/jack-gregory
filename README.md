Welcome and thanks for stopping by!  

I am an energy economist and data scientist. I create bespoke workflows and analyses to leverage data and solve problems.

I am primarily an R developer, but I also have experience in Python, Julia and SQL.

Feel free to explore my projects here, while more information can be found at my [website](https://jack-gregory.github.io/).
